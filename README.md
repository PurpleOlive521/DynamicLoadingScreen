###### Dynamic Loading Screen 
A Unreal subsystem that dynamically adds a loading screen widget to cover transitions between levels and menus.
Manually injects a slate widget when the engine signals that a transition is occuring, allowing designers
to use any widget they desire. 
Features a custom settings page to configure the loading screen behaviour, featuring setting such
as minimum up-time, hiding the loading screen in-editor, enabling debugging tools and more.
